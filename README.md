# Process-Control-equpment-Simulations
 OPCUA Process Control Equipment library
 Currently consist of 

1 - OPC UA Flow Control Valve Server Implementation
This program implements an OPC UA server for a flow control valve, with configurable parameters like control signal, upstream pressure, valve characteristic, and error behaviors (stiction, dead time, hysteresis, and positioner error). The server exposes these parameters to clients and allows them to interact with the valveâ€™s configuration and receive real-time updates on the valve's state (opening and flow).
Integrating OPC UA flow control valve server with a industrial control systems (ICS) like Siemens PLCs and ABB 800xA should be possible.

2 # Three-Phase Separator Simulation with OPC UA Interface
A physics-based simulation of an oil-water-gas separator with real-time monitoring/control via OPC UA.
